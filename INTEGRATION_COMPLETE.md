### What Was Accomplished

1. **Tabbed Interface Implementation**
   - Restructured `studio_gui_engines_v3_14.py` with modern tabbed interface
   - Created separate tabs for File Processing, Target Detection, and About
   - Maintained all existing functionality while adding new capabilities

2. **Target Detection Integration**
   - Added `TARGET_DETECTION_AVAILABLE` flag for graceful degradation
   - Integrated `block_target_detection.py` module into GUI
   - Created comprehensive target detection interface with controls and visualization

3. **User Interface Enhancements**
   - Professional layout with consistent styling
   - Progress tracking for long operations
   - Real-time status updates and error handling
   - Threaded operations to prevent UI freezing

4. **Advanced Features**
   - SAR (Search and Rescue) detection mode
   - Wreck hunting capabilities  
   - Professional report generation
   - Detection sensitivity controls
   - Results visualization and export

## ðŸš€ Ready for Use

The enhanced RSD Studio GUI with integrated target detection is now complete and ready for deployment. The tabbed interface successfully separates standard file processing from advanced target detection while maintaining a clean, professional user experience.

### To Launch:
```bash
cd "c:\Temp\Garmin_RSD_releases\testing new design"
python studio_gui_engines_v3_14.py
```

### Quick Start:
1. Use **File Processing** tab for standard RSD parsing and preview
2. Switch to **Target Detection** tab for advanced SAR/wreck hunting analysis  
3. Check **About** tab for feature information and version details

The integration maintains full backward compatibility while adding powerful new capabilities for specialized users and educational applications.
